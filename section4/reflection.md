## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?  I noticed that when I use the Pomodoro technique I am more focused and get more done.  I downloaded it on to my chrome and I have chimes that go off.  Prior I would work longer and get really fried.  I didn't realize it could make that much of a difference.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?  I was more focused than I realized.  I still have troubled times during the day where I get a bit more tired - however I found the Pomodoro Technique and sipping Ice Water combined helped me push through.  My estimating times are usually off - I always pad a lot of time.  

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An Array is an index list type.. all related.  It can only have numbers, strings or booleans in them... but an Object is extremely complex and is not ordered/indexed - it can have anything in them that are related to the object - and it can have all those data types including arrays and Objects.  


1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class  - An Array
  * List of states and their capitals - object
  * List of things to pack for vacation - Object
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - array
  * List of student names and their cohort - Object
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - Object
  * All my favorite restaurants - Array

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values? Lords Mobile - web App game.  I assume it has Keys for Troops - tier level, Might, UpKeep, Carrying Capacity. Example values -(T2, 8, 2, 9)

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects  I have more questions about parameters and arguments...what are the difference between the two?
