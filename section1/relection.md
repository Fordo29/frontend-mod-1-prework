## Section 1 Reflection

#####1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?  
⋅⋅* It resonated with me that SuperLearners adopt a growth mindset and teach others what they have learned.  I know from topics in the past I have gotten passionate about I will devour information about it and find individuals that would like to talk about the same topic.  One habit I want to start doing is taking more frequent and small breaks instead of taking longer breaks less frequently.  

#####2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
**3 Data Types**
⋅⋅* Number Data type - all numbers including negative and decimals.  Large numbers are written without the comma.
⋅⋅* String Data type - consists of some character or an array of characters (anything letter, number, special character, or even emojis) all wrapped in single or double quotation marks.
⋅⋅* Boolean Data type - this is a data type that compares values and has a result of `true` or `false`
#####3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log("Hello World!")
#####4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// used to determine a comment and it greys out the text.  It is used for developer notes on a piece of code.  
#####5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a value in code that can be used and re-used multiple times in multiple places.  It allows a developer to store and use information all over the application.  For example when you log on to a website and it says your Name at the top of the page that is a variable that is tied to your login and can be used all over the website.   
#####6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
While visiting Amazon.com, I see an image of my most recent order - I assume that is a variable of the lastOrder and passed through code to display an image and a link to click to view the order.  Also I see my first name at the top of the page showing that I have logged into the website.  I believe that is a variable of my first name pulled to be displayed at the top.  Also my location is also listed... that is a variable that is saved of my location.  All 3 are boolean data types that only display if I am logged into my account.  

#####7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
A concatenation is a joining together of strings.  It is similiar to a addition math equation because you use the + symbol to join together Strings or phrases, etc.
#####8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
Actually, Amazon uses concatenation right at the top with my name! It says Hello, (myName)
#####9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I am still not clear on booleans. Specifically, the difference between == verses ===.
